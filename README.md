# TensorFlowExamples

A repository following some training material on using neural nets with TensorFlow

I am trying out a new virtual env setup for this project, making use of pyenv. To install relevant python packages to pyenv:

```
pyenv activate tensorflow
pip install <package>
pyenv deactivate tensorflow
```
The tensorflow environment was originally created and connected to jupyter following this blog post: https://www.alfredo.motta.name/create-isolated-jupyter-ipython-kernels-with-pyenv-and-virtualenv/

I am using this pyenv method to have the newest version of TensorFlow, which requires newer versions of a lot of dependency packages than I have installed on my MAcbook.
